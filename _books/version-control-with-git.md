In this Pocket Guide, Ryan Taylor will introduce you to Git, a version control system that will change the way you manage your work and collaborate with teammates. Code fearlessly, knowing that every change you make is tracked, versioned and revertible at any time. Git’s capabilities are vast but getting started is simple. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll never look back.
