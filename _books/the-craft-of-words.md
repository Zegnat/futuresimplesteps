‘The Craft of Words’ – now available as a discounted bundle, combining both books – examines the role of words as an integral part of the design process, shaping users’ experiences.

‘Part 1: Macrocopy’ demonstrates how a respect for the craft of words can lead to better and more engaging user experiences and add an often overlooked, but important element, to your design toolbox.

‘Part 2: Microcopy’ examines the craft of words at a more focused level, exploring how words can enhance interfaces at the service of both function and delight.

Previously published by Five Simple Steps, both books are now available as a discounted bundle in PDF, ePub and Kindle formats.
