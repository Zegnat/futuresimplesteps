Web pages are getting larger and slower to load, and we seem to be relying on browser and network improvements to rescue us.

Visitors have expectations that pages should be faster but by stretching their patience, there’s a danger they will spend less time on our sites, visit fewer pages and buy less.

This book guides you through why performance matters, how to improve it, why the methods work, and some of the trade-offs involved. 

You’ll learn practical techniques to improve website performance and be introduced to approaches that you can experiment with too.
