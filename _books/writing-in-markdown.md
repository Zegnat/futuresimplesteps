Markdown lets you use plain text formatting conventions that you've probably already seen a hundred times – and perhaps even used yourself – to make documents that are not only clean and readable as-is, but which can also be readily converted into HTML and other rich formats.

In this ultra-brief and to-the-point book, you'll learn why Markdown is so powerful, and how to use it to create your own documents. We'll cover syntax, tools, editors, advanced features, and suggested style. If you have just twenty minutes to spare, you can master Markdown.
