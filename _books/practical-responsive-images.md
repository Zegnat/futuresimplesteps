In this pocket guide weâ€™ll consider the cost and value of images, review image formats and historic practices, and explore some of the new features and tools available to us, such that we can be in a position to undertake a practical approach to responsive images.

It can often be easier to learn by doing, so most code examples are made available for you to review and experiment with via a zero-install live coding environment. You will quickly be able to see how you might start to exploit the new approaches in your own projects.
