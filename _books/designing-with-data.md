In recent years, the terms visualization, infographic and others have been bantered around with almost no regard to their use or meaning. There is a new vernacular emerging in the realms of data representations, but that doesn’t mean we can ignore the much simpler origins and best practices of charts and graphs.

Brian Suda takes you on a journey through the basics and makes it easy to produce beautiful looking, accurate representations of data. He’ll walk you through how to visualize and design data in such a way that it engages the reader and tells a story rather than just being flashy, cluttered and confusing.

Designing with Data is a visual feast. With over 200 illustrations, Brian leads you by the hand through the early history of charts and graphs through to complex visualisations. If you need to display data in any form, you need this book.
