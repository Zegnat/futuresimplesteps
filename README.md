### How to add a book

Create a new file in the `_books` folder with your book title as the filename and ending in the extension `.md` (use hyphens instead of spaces).

Copy the following code and paste it into your file:

```
---
author-name: "Your Full Name"
author-name-short: "Your First Name"
author-website: "https://mywebsite.com"
author-twitter: "twitterhandle"
book-title: "My Book Title"
book-slug: "your-book-title"
book-url: "https://mywebsite.com/where-you-can-buy-my-book"
---

The book blub goes here, and the format is Markdown.

```

Edit the contents.

Commit the changes.
